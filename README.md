Developed by **Edward Tian**, a Princeton University student, GPTZero is an AI-powered tool that analyzes writing patterns to detect machine-generated content. It uses sophisticated algorithms to measure:  
- **Perplexity** – How complex or unpredictable the text is (AI tends to be less random).  
- **Burstiness** – Variations in sentence structure (humans write with more spontaneity).  

Unlike basic plagiarism checkers, GPTZero specializes in spotting the subtle fingerprints of AI-generated writing.
